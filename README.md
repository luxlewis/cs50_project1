# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is called Biblio-files. It contains the following:

Application.py - this is the main program which includes all of the code which runs flask. I have 8 flask app routes including register/login/logout/book_search/API request/search_results/book_page/submit_review.

import.py - This file imports the books.csv file into a postgres database called books.

tables.sql - creates the database tables necessary to run the program.

Templates - there are 10 templates, including a base.html/error.html/index.html/register.html/book_search.html/search_results.html/book_page.html/login/logout.html/api.html.
